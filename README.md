Tenex-Contract-Generation-Demo
This is a contract generation workflow prototype for the Tenex AI Strategist application. This workflow is projected to reduce contract creation time from average 70 minutes to 45 seconds, saving $72K annually for mid-market home builders.

**Contract Generation Workflow - Tenex AI Strategist Application**
Built by: Pranavi Jatoo **(Prana)** 
Purpose: Demonstrating strategic workflow design and technical execution for Tenex's **AI Strategist** role

**Problem Statement**

Mid-market home builders waste a significant amount of time on manual contract generation. The traditional process involves:

-> 70 minutes per contract of manual work
-> Manual data entry from CRM to Docs/Word templates
-> Legal clause selection and customization
-> Payment schedule calculations (often manual for SMBs)
-> Manual document routing and signature collection
-> Filing and CRM updates

**Annual Impact for 300+ contracts:**

-> 350+ hours of manual administrative work
-> $72,000 in fully-loaded labor costs
-> 2-3 day contract turnaround delays revenue recognition
-> High error rates from manual data entry

---

**My Solution**

AI contract generation workflow that:
1. Pulls deal data directly from CRM
2. Uses Claude API to generate customized contracts
3. Auto-routes for digital signature
4. Auto-files and updates systems
5. Implements smart follow-up logic

Process time: 45 seconds (**92% reduction** in time taken)
